# Pokedex- Mini Project #2
> By Irena Liu

> Last updated: July 10th, 2020

This pokedex application was duplicated using the tutorials/ example code from Shingai's FragmentsApp. The purpose was to learn how he used Fragments and the ViewPager in his app.

## Concepts Learned
1. From Shingai's FragmentsApp
    - What are fragments and how to use them
    - How to use the ViewPager
        - Creating a FragmentStateAdapter for the ViewPager
    - How to use a tab layout
    - Using a "BaseActivity"
2. How to restructure java project packages
    - When you have the package selected, press F6 to move package elsewhere

## Notes Re: The Implementation
I read Shingai's word document. He gave a general overview/ explanation of the concepts of the fragments, viewpager and other things you need to know but there wasn't any step by step instructions. 

Shingai's code in his app was pretty easy to follow along with for the most part. I would've appreciated some more comments in his code to help understand his next steps and logic. I think the only thing that made it more confusing was that there were many classes all in one package. When I implemented his project, I decided to reorganize it in my own app.
